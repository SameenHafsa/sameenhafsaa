Portfolio
Welcome to my Personal Portfolio! ðŸŽ‰ Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this site showcases my skills, projects, and professional journey in a visually appealing and responsive design.

Live Site: https://sameenhafsaa.vercel.app/

Purpose
This project was initiated as a boosted response to the realities of job searching. With every application I sent out, portfolios became a requirement â€” so what better way to stand out than to create my own? ðŸ˜Ž This portfolio serves as both my digital resume and a creative expression of who I am and what I can do.

Itâ€™s my space to showcase the projects Iâ€™ve worked on, my technical skills, and all the work Iâ€™m proud of. Not only does it help employers find me, but it also gives me a chance to prove I know how to code and build something from scratch (hint: I do!). ðŸ™Œ

Features
Responsive Design: The portfolio looks great on all devices, so you can browse it on mobile, tablet, or desktop.
Smooth Scrolling & Navigation: A seamless navigation experience that makes it easier to move through the portfolio.
Flower Grid: Because life is too short for dull designs, I added a beautiful flower grid (thanks to a genius article). ðŸŒ¸

Technologies Used
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
